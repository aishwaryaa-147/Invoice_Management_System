## Sample Data

The application includes a sample invoice to help you get started. You can delete it or use it as a template for creating new invoices.

## Data Backup

Since data is stored in local storage, you can backup your data by:

2. Going to Application/Storage tab
3. Finding "Local Storage" for your domain
4. Copying the "invoices" and "users" data

To restore data, simply paste the JSON data back into local storage.

**Note**: Each user's data is stored separately, so you'll need to backup data for each user account individually.
