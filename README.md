# Invoice_Management_System
The Invoice Management System is a simple and interactive web-based billing application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a Node.js (Express) server. This system allows users to add invoice items with name and price dynamically. The total bill amount is automatically calculated and updated in real-time as new items are added.
